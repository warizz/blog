List of good things I can think of for year 2018 in alphabetical order.

- __Book__, [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Subtle-Art-of-Not-Giving-a-F-ck-Audiobook/B01I28NFEE). It is a good start for a __focused__ life

- __Fellow developer__, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov). Aside from his skill (He's one of `react` team and creator of `redux`), he wrote a lot of articles with humble and friendly tone. This website also ~~copied from~~ influenced by [his blog](https://overreacted.io).

- __Game__, [Hollow Knight](https://youtu.be/UAO2urG23S4). Solid game design (2D souls-like) great music and visual.

- __Movie__, [Hereditary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_%28film%29). The genre is horror which it do very good job combine with weird, shock and unpredictable moment make watching the movie is my best experience of 2018 so far. __WARNING__ don't watch trailer or read synopsis so you can fully experience feelings I described above.

- __Music band__, [Telex Telexs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1BHYRsFqV0ON7RUFM9qF2Q?si=2uEhCALaRN2IoRYk41Bplw). Best synth-pop band in Thailand (I don't know much though). Record in Spotify said this is my most favorited band in 2018.

- __New item__, nothing. I barely bought anything new this year (clothes excluded) but I still put it this list just to brag about buying less.

- __Trip__, [ABC trekking (Nepal)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/eQ8t8eVvBQPoZc2n8). 2nd time to Nepal (my first was EBC trekking). This time was better because I went there with my girl and it was super fun. I will never want to travel without her again.
