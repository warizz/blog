tldr: "\"Meaningfulness\" and \"efficiency\""

## Efficiency
There are 2 factors for evaluation, __time__ and __money__. Easiest way to improve is growing the value of money/time.

## Meaningfulness
I thought about it for couple of months, and got a rough conclusion that __I care about how many people using my work__ so I will use it as a indicator, google analytics can help you about this. I donâ€™t think this is the best way to measure how meaningful of a work and I will continue finding it.
