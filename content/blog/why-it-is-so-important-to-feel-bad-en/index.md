> You don't build psychological resilience by feeling good all the time, you build psychological resilience by getting good at feeling bad.

Mark Manson pointed out that we will be more fragile if we handle the bad feeling by avoiding them. For me, how we confronting anxiety is a skill which we will be bad at it at first but we will get better if we practice more.

> Learning how to exist and be productive and do good things and be nice to people despite the fact that you feel like shit. The problem isn't that you feel like shit, the problem is that you behave like shit and blame it on your feeling.

I really like the paragraph. I want to print and put it on my wall or set it as my phone's wallpaper as a reminder when I'm not feeling good that I should behave like normal in any situation.

Not only the sadness, but I think I can use this principle for all other unpleasant feelings like anger, worry, or excitement.
