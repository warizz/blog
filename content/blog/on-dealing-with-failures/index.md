Failure is a good thing if you handle it well.

- What — note it down, every single one of them should be listed.
- Why — find the root cause.
- How — try to think about how to prevent it to happen again in the future.

The key is to learn from your mistake, embrace it. What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger (yeah, super cliché but true).
