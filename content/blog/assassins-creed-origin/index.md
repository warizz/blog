Assassin's Creed Origin is not a challenging game like Soul titles and not revolutionize any genre, furthermore it has a lot of repetitive gameplays but if you are the kind of person like me that love ticking off a small and easy task one by one no matter how boring it is, this game is for you.

The visual and sound feedback when you have got any progress is amazing, a golden aura and small ripple of wind cover up your body when you leveling up, a ding sound and many small white dots float up in the air when you pick a loot (bigger sound and visual if you get a rare one), the golden particles fly from XP points in the middle of the screen to your progress bar, and so on. Everything was crafted to make you feels so satisfy and crave for more, just a little more before I'm going to bed (and you know the result).

Plus, the combat system has improved a lot since my last play of the series many years ago (Brotherhood maybe?), it is not counter button mashing anymore. You can now change your gears, shield, various type of melee weapons and bows which they a have slightly different style of gameplay for you to use and collect.

The Trophies also not hard to be completed, no skill required just need more time after finished all the main quests. I got the Platinum in like, 60-70 hours.
