Listening is the best thing I can think of right now while I’m on commute. Podcast, audio book (Youtube sometimes but annoying when you must turn on the screen while playing it) have lots of good content to listen.

Audio book — I’m using Audible, with monthly subscription you get a credit to buy a free book every month. I wish Thai publishers have something like this.

Podcast — Here’s the list. I think you can search their name on any podcast app you’re using.
- __THE STANDARD podcast__ (Thai) — they have lots of topics from financial to running.
- __mission the moon__ (Thai) — life, work and entrepreneurship.
- __React podcast__ — programming, React specifically.
- __This Old App__ — programming

## Tips
- Increase play back speed so you can listen more.
- Noise cancellation headphone is perfect on public transport.
- Always bring a book with you, in some situation that you can not use your headphone.
